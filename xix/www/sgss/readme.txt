SIMPLE GAMES SITE SCRIPT
------------------------


Required
--------
A web host, that supports php
The files, that are distributed with this file that you are reading.


Aditional
---------
The ability to edit these simple php scripts into something that you like , you will need to do that, a nicer layout etc is your problem :)


How?
----

Edit these files to your liking.

game.php is single game display

games.php is the games list display

games.css you like css right?

swfobject.js The wonderful swfobject code -> http://blog.deconcept.com/swfobject/

admin.php sets everything up, you should run it occasionally to get new games. ( crontab is your friend )

There is a simple comented out password check at the top of the file if you want to enable it.

upload these files (the files you got with this file) to somewhere on your server (you need a server remember)

open the admin.php in a web browser,

this will create a games and a data subdirectory and read the mochi games feed for new games creating lots of files within them

this may take some time

wait for it to finish , there will be  splurge of all the tas used by the games at the end

you may now visit games.php on your site and play any games you see

you are free to hack these scripts around as you like

In fact I sugest you do it now

but remember

there is no support!!!!1111oneoneone

If things go bad, you are on your own :)
