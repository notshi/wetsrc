##wetkongfix
A simple example of removing the negativity from a ratings system, whilst letting the users continue to rate. Based only on live data that is already available on the page this shows a very simple alternative to the rate out of 5 then average the results that every freaking site decides is the best and easiest option :)

1/5 for the kongretards.
